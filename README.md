# E6B

This is the source kit for an E6B software application which was formerly offered by Glenview Software, my own corporation. I originally wrote this application after I started taking flying lessons in order to understand the calculations that were being performed for navigation, fuel consumption and conversions between true airspeed and indicated airspeed, and pressure verses density altitude.

So what happened is that when I took a new contract that required my company to carry liability insurance, one of the requirements was to take the software down for liability purposes. The problem is that an insurance company won't underwrite general liability on a company that creates software that may be used for navigational or fuel burn for pilots.

I've transferred ownership of the software from Glenview Software back to myself, and I'm now posting the software as open source for legacy purposes under the GNU General Public License.

If you wish to license the software or parts of the software for incorporation into your own software for commercial distribution, please contact me directly.

## Description

The E6B application performs many of the more basic flight navigation computations used by general aviation pilots. With an extensive on-line help system, E6B permits you to make quick work of various navigational, weight and balance, and fuel problems, as well as performing basic arithmetic calculations and built-in unit conversion.

The E6B is capable of performing the following calculations:

- Pressure and Density Altitude
- Va (Maneuvering) Speed
- True Air Speed
- Required Calibrated Airspeed
- Cloud Base Estimator
- True Course/Speed
- Heading for True Course
- Wind Speed and Direction
- True Heading/Speed for Course
- Cross Wind Calculator
- Magnetic Course/Heading
- True Course/Heading
- Calculate Speed
- Distance Traveled
- Leg Time Calculator
- Fuel Required
- Fuel Burn Rate
- Fuel Endurance

The E6B application also provides unit conversion calculators for distance, speed, weight, temperature, volume and pressure, as well as calculating the weight or volume for aviation fuel, JP-4, Kerosene and oil.

This E6B includes an all-in-one planning calculator panel which allows you to quickly on one screen plan a leg of a course, calculating the magnetic heading and course, as well as the true heading, ETA, fuel burn and ground speed without switching between panels.

The weight and balance feature of this E6B application will also allow you to quickly work weight and balance problems in a convenient tabular form, saving individual problems for quick reference later.

This E6B also contains a weight and balance calculator which can graphically represent the results of a calculation for a number of popular aircraft, including graphically representing the fuel burn-down to help you keep your plane in balance during the entire flight. For known aircraft Glenview Software will also show the Va maneuvering speed at the current weight and at the fuel empty weight so you can fly your entire trip safely.

## Disclamer

The calculations performed by this application are derived from various public sources, and the results should be used only for educational or advisory purposes only. The results of this application should not be relied upon for navigational or for flight planning purposes. While we believe the results of these calculations to be correct, there are no guarantees that these results are in fact correct. You should always double-check your results using official sources, and you should always pay attention to what's going on outside the airplane while in flight: remember, your first priority is to fly the plane. And your second is not to hit anything.
