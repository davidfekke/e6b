			<h1>V<sub>a</sub> (Maneuvering) speed</h1>
			<p>Maneuvering Speed is an airspeed limitation of an aircraft. At speeds close to or greater than maneuvering speed, full deflection of any flight
			control surface should not be attempted due to risk of aircraft structural damage.</p>
			<p>Aircraft maneuvering speeds for an aircraft is typically given at the maximum (fully loaded) weight of an aircraft. However, the actual maximum
			maneuvering speed of an aircraft decreases as your aircraft's total weight decreases. This calculator can be used to calculate the maneuvering speed
			of an aircraft given it's current weight.</p>
			<h1>Sample Problem</h1>
			<p>Your Cessna has a maximum weight of 2450 lbs, and a V<sub>a</sub> of 99 knots. After performing your W&B calculations you find the total loaded
			weight of the aircraft is 2280 lbs. Find the safe maneuvering speed for your aircraft at it's actual weight.</p>
