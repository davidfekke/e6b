			<h1>About E6B</h1>
			<p>Copyright &copy; 2016 by William Woody, all rights reserved.</p>
			<p>I'm in the process of pursuing my VFR pilots certificate, and part of the process is better
			understanding how to do basic navigation, performance and fuel consumption problems. Well, the
			best way for me to learn a thing is to build a program to do it. And thus, the
			E6B software package was born.</p>
