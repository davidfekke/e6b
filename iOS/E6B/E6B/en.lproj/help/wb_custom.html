			<h1>Customize Aircraft</h1>
			<p>You can customize the aircraft used in weight and balance calculations.</p>
			<h1>Opening the aircraft editor</h1>
			<p>In the Weight and Balance list of calculations, click the "Aircraft Editor" in the lower right. An Aircraft Editor will appear allowing you to
			create and duplicate templates and edit them.</p>
			<h1>Duplicate an existing aircraft</h1>
			<p>In the Aircraft Editor, press "Copy Template". This will allow you to pick a pre-defined aircraft and make a copy that can be modified.</p>
			<h1>Add a new template</h1>
			<p>You can create a new template from scratch by pressing the '+' button in the lower left.</p>
			<h1>Duplicate or delete existing templates</h1>
			<p>Press the 'Edit' button in the upper right. To duplicate, select the aircraft template you wish to duplicate and press the 'Duplicate' button. To delete
			pick the red delete button on the left of the template and confirm.</p>
			<h1>Editing a template</h1>
			<p>You can edit a template by picking the specified aircraft in the template list.</p>
			<p>The parameters you need to supply for each aircraft are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Manufacturer</b> The manufacturer who built the aircraft. (i.e., Cessna, Bonanza, Mooney, etc.)</li>
				<li><b>Aircraft Type</b> The model or type of aircraft. (i.e., C172R, G36, etc.)</li>
				<li><b>Name</b> The name of the template; typically the aircraft's N number.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These parameters are used to help identify the aircraft, and can be anything you wish. The following parameters are used to define the units
			that are used when specifying the aircraft:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Weight</b> The unit used for weight (lbs, kg, etc)</li>
				<li><b>Arm</b> The unit used for arm (inches, cm)</li>
				<li><b>Moment</b> Unit used for moment (foot-inches, kg-cm).</li>
				<li><b>Speed</b> Unit used for speed (knots, mph, etc).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Aircraft Data is data associated with the aircraft as a whole:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>V<sub>a</sub></b> The maneuvering speed for your aircraft</li>
				<li><b>Max Weight</b> The maximum weight for your aircraft (used in calculating V<sub>a</sub>)</li>
				<li><b>Empty Weight</b> The measured empty weight of your aircraft.</li>
				<li><b>Emtpy Arm</b> The measured empty arm for your aircraft.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Station Locations allow you to define certain predefined arm locations, such as the arm of the pilot's seat or the baggage compartment.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Station Data: Name</b> The label used to describe the location (i.e., "Pilot Seat", "Baggage Compartment")</li>
				<li><b>Station Data: Arm</b> The distance from the datum for the location</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Fuel Tank Locations allow you to define one or more fuel tanks, the carrying capacity of each tank and the type of fuel used. While the system permits
			an unlimited number of fuel tanks to be specified, the E6B's internal algorithms makes the practical limit around 8 to 10 different
			station locations for fuel.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Fuel Tank: Name</b> A descriptive label for the fuel tank station (i.e., "Main Tanks", "Tip Tanks")</li>
				<li><b>Fuel Tank: Volume</b> The maximum carrying capacity of the fuel tank.</li>
				<li><b>Fuel Tank: Units</b> The unit used in describing the volume of fuel. (Gallons, Liters)</li>
				<li><b>Fuel Tank: Type</b> The type of fuel, typically aviation gas.</li>
				<li><b>Fuel Tank: Arm</b> The distance from the datum for this tank.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Weight/Balance Envelope</p>
			<p>The data entered here allows you to define the limits of the weight and balance for this aircraft, for different types of aircraft use. For
			example, you can define the weight and balance limits for normal use and for utility use for a Cessna 172 by entering two weight/balance 
			envelopes. Each graph is specified by a name and by the weight/arm points that define the enclosing polygon for the graph. Units are specified in
			the weight and arm units above.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Envelope Name</b> A descriptive label for the polygon defining the weight and balance limits for this usage. (i.e., "Normal", "Utility")</li>
				<li><b>Envelope Data: Weight</b> One of several points for each polygon specifying the weight at that point.</li>
				<li><b>Envelope Data: Arm</b> One of several points for each polygon specifying the arm at that point.</li>
			</ul>
