			<h1>Create new W&B Calculation</h1>
			<p>By default an untitled W&B calculation is created in the weight and balance list. You can use that empty calculation or you can create one by
			pressing the "+" button in the lower left.</p>
			<p>To edit a calculation you tap on the calculation's name in the weight and balance calculation list.</p>
			<h1>Renaming the Calculation</h1>
			<p>Tap the green name of the calculation (once you are editing the calculation), and enter a new name. The calculation will also be renamed in the
			list of weight and balance calculations.</p>
			<h1>Specifying an aircraft</h1>
			<p>Tap on the "Pick Aircraft" label (or the currently selected aircraft if one is picked), and choose a new aircraft from the list of aircraft.
			The aircraft's weight, fuel tank and station locations will be updated after a new aircraft is selected.</p>
			<h1>Edit the values.</h1>
			<p>You can modify the weight and arm for any element of the aircraft, including the aircraft's empty weight, the fuel tank contents, and the
			station weight and arms.</p>
			<p>By default two spaces for two stations are created. You can add more spaces for stations by selecting the green "+" button. Delete a station
			location by selecting the '-' button. At each station you can specify the weight and the station arm; select the diamond button to the left of the arm
			to pick from a list of predefined station arm lengths.</p>
			<h1>Results</h1>
			<p>The total weight, arm and moment of the aircraft is displayed underneath the input fields. A graph is displayed showing the aircraft's permitted
			weight and balance ranges, and the aircraft's current weight and balance profile. If your aircraft has two or more fuel tank locations, the weight
			and balance graph will show a region showing all possible ranges of fuel tank values from the current contents down to empty.</p>
