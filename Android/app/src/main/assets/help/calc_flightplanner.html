			<h1>Flight Planning Calculator</h1>
			<p>The flight planning calculator consolidates the calculations for several E6B calculations into one location, to simplify calculating
			each leg of a flight plan. The individual calculations that are performed include performing a wind triangle calculation to find ground speed
			and heading for course, the fuel burn, and estimated time of arrival for each leg.</p>
			<h1>Sample Problem</h1>
			<img border="0" height="225" width="310" src="sample_map.png">
			<p>You are flying from the Fillmore VOR north-west of the Los Angeles area to the San Marcus VOR just north of Santa Barbara. The true course is 282&deg;
			and the distance is 45nm. Your Cessna has a cruising true air speed of 110 knots, and consumes 8 gallons/hour. From your weather briefing you
			discover the winds aloft in the area is 120&deg; at 15 knots, and the magnetic variation is 13&deg; east.</p>
