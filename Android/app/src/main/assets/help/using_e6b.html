			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>This E6B application is designed to perform 19 common aeronautic calculations used in General Aviation, along with
			6 groups of conversion calculations, and fuel weight calculations.</p>
			<p>Designed to work both on the iPhone and iPad, you can quickly switch between different calculations used for both flight planning
			and for in-flight calculations to verify your flight planning. The E6B application also contains an all-in-one calculator for flight
			planning, calculating course, heading, ETA and fuel requirements for each leg quickly on one screen.</p>
			<p>The E6B application also contains a weight and balance calculator which allows you to save multiple weight and balance problems
			for quick and easy reference, graphically representing the results and even calculating estimated V<sub>a</sub> for the calculated weight.
			The E6B's built-in Weight and Balance calculator can handle most general aviation aircraft with a nearly unlimited number
			of stations and fuel tank locations, and can graphically represent both the current weight and balance as well as all possible combinations
			of fuel depletion from each tank to allow you to see if any combination of fuel tank contents causes your aircraft to be out of balance.
